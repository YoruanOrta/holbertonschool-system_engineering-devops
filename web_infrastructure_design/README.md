## Requirements
### General
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- For each task:
    - Whiteboard your solution (using a whiteboard, paper, or software of your choice) and take a picture/screenshot of your diagram.
    - Upload the screenshot to an image hosting service (e.g., Imgur).
    - Insert the link to your screenshot into the answer file.
    - Push your answer file to GitHub and insert the GitHub file link into the URL box.
- You will whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff, or student without using a computer or notes.

### Tips
- Focus on the requirements; details will be explored in later projects.
- You will have 30 minutes to complete the exercise. Stick to what is asked.
- In job interviews, answer only what is asked. Avoid being overly verbose unless prompted.

*Note: Avoid unnecessary details unless explicitly required.*
